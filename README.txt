Game play:
-	Buildings’ build menu can be opened by left clicking on any blank part of the screen, and right click can be used to close the build menu or to deselected gatherer units.
-	Current amounts of resources are shown in the upper left hand corner
-	Objectives are shown in the upper right hand corner, an empty yellow star designates an uncompleted objective and a yellow star with a pink middle designates a completed one.
-	Mini map displays where both player’s units and buildings are, as well as visible enemy units are on the map and can be clicked to move to that location or dragged to desired location
-	Units that are gathering cannot be controlled and the buildings have to be close enough to the desired resource for it to be collected, in other words, the bears don’t want to wander off on their own to find resources and risk being attacked.
-	The only units that can be controlled by the player and therefore used to attack the enemy units are the polar bears.  Polar bears are spawned when a bearracks is built and can be selected with left click and directed where to go or who to attack by use of a right click, left clicking somewhere not on the bear deselects the polar bear.
